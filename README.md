3)Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure 
and display the records in ascending order of roll list.

4)Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure 
and display the records in descending order of percentange.

5)Write a C program to find largest element in an array

6)Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. TRAVERSE
4. SEARCH

7)Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int 
minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the 
following operations:
1. Input new time
2. Display the time
3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the 
time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is 
set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute 
member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour 
becomes 24, it is set to zero.

8)Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 
otherwise
